# Research Pipeline UI Improvements

## Overview
Fixed missing "Quality Evaluation" stage in the UI and added dropdown functionality to show detailed stage information.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Missing Quality Evaluation Stage
**Problem**: The UI was only showing 4 stages instead of 5:
- ✅ Research Planning
- ✅ Information Gathering  
- ❌ **Quality Evaluation** (MISSING)
- ✅ Content Summarization
- ✅ Report Assembly

**Solution**: Added the missing "Quality Evaluation" stage to the `research_stages` array in `web_ui.py`.

### 2. No Detailed Stage Information
**Problem**: Stages only showed basic status without detailed breakdown of:
- Current operation details
- Progress percentage
- Tokens used
- API calls made
- Duration
- Responsible agent
- Timestamp

**Solution**: Created expandable stage cards with detailed dropdown information.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`web_ui.py`)

1. **Updated research_stages definition**:
```python
# Before
research_stages = [
    {"name": "Research Planning", "status": "pending"},
    {"name": "Information Gathering", "status": "pending"},
    {"name": "Content Summarization", "status": "pending"},
    {"name": "Report Assembly", "status": "pending"}
]

# After  
research_stages = [
    {"name": "Research Planning", "status": "pending", "details": {}},
    {"name": "Information Gathering", "status": "pending", "details": {}},
    {"name": "Quality Evaluation", "status": "pending", "details": {}},
    {"name": "Content Summarization", "status": "pending", "details": {}},
    {"name": "Report Assembly", "status": "pending", "details": {}}
]
```

2. **Enhanced progress callback with detailed stage information**:
- Added current operation tracking
- Added progress percentage per stage
- Added timestamp tracking
- Added stage-specific metrics (tokens, API calls, duration, agent)

### Frontend Changes (`App.jsx`)

1. **Created new StageCard component** with:
   - Visual status indicators (spinner, checkmark, clock)
   - Expandable dropdown functionality  
   - Detailed metrics display
   - Responsive badge layout
   - Hover interactions

2. **Features of StageCard**:
   - **Status Icons**: 
     - ✅ Completed (green checkmark)
     - 🔄 In Progress (blue spinning icon)
     - ⏰ Pending (gray clock)
     - ❌ Error (red exclamation)
   
   - **Metrics Badges**: Tokens used, Duration, API calls
   
   - **Dropdown Details**:
     - Current operation description
     - Progress bar with percentage
     - Responsible agent name
     - Last updated timestamp
     - Detailed token/call metrics

## Stage Mapping (Backend → Frontend)

| Stage Index | Backend Stage | Frontend Display | Agent Responsible |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 0 | research_planning | Research Planning | ResearchPlannerAgent |
| 1 | information_gathering | Information Gathering | WebSearchRetrieverAgent |
| 2 | **quality_evaluation** | **Quality Evaluation** | **QualityEvaluationAgent** |
| 3 | content_summarization | Content Summarization | SummarizerAgent |
| 4 | report_assembly | Report Assembly | ReportSynthesizerAgent |

## Visual Improvements

### Before:
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Pipeline Visibility**: Users now see all 5 stages including the previously hidden Quality Evaluation
2. **Detailed Progress Tracking**: Real-time information about what each agent is doing
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Token usage, API calls, and timing per stage
4. **Better UX**: Expandable cards provide details on demand without cluttering the interface
5. **Debugging Aid**: Detailed stage information helps identify bottlenecks and issues

## Testing

The web UI is now running on `http://localhost:8080` with the improvements applied. Users can:
1. See the "Quality Evaluation" stage in the pipeline
2. Click on any stage card to expand detailed information
3. Monitor real-time progress with enhanced metrics
4. Track individual agent performance and resource usage
